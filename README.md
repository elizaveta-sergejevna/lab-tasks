# lab-tasks, committing and pushing

This was painful. I had trouble pushing the changes in my files even though I Google'ed myself to death trying to find answers </3 I did everything "by the book",
but it still didn't work. I have no idea how I managed to do it in the end; I think I did everything exactly the same way I've tried before and by some miraculous
coincidence it worked.

The reason for the "LOL" is that I was tired and didn't think the process would actually come through :-)

Goodbye.
